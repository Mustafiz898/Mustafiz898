# GitHub Profile Snake Contribution Graph üêç

This repository contains a GitHub Actions workflow to generate a snake animation that visualizes the contributions made on your GitHub profile. The snake graph will be dynamically updated each day to reflect your recent contributions.

## How it works:

1. The snake graph is generated by a GitHub Action workflow which runs every day at midnight using cron jobs.
2. It visualizes the GitHub contributions in the form of a snake that eats up the green squares in your contribution graph.

## How to Set Up:

### 1. Create Repository
- Create a new public repository named `<your-username>/<your-username>` or any name you'd prefer.

### 2. Add GitHub Actions Workflow
- In the root of your repository, create the following folder structure: `.github/workflows/`.
- Inside the `workflows` folder, create a new file named `snake.yml` (all within this `README.md` file).

### 3. Workflow Configuration
- Here's the GitHub Actions workflow setup (you don't need to create a separate file; it's integrated within this repository's `README.md` file):
```yaml
name: Generate Snake Game

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"  # Runs once a day at midnight
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Generate Snake Game from Contributions
        uses: Platane/snk@v2
        with:
          github_user_name: <your-username>  # Replace with your GitHub username
          outputs: "dist/snake.svg"

      - name: Upload to repository
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: snake-graph
          path: dist/snake.svg

      - name: Generate Snake Game animation
        run: |
          git add dist/snake.svg
          git commit -m "Generate snake animation"
          git push
